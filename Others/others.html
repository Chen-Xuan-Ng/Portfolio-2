        <small>My solution: a robot that can pump water when it detects that the soil is dry. It must also have a motor to control the height of the lamp, so the plant would be as close to as possible to the lamp, to receive the most amount of light from the lamp. </small>

        <small class="about">One major problem faced was what we suspected as a power issue. The Arduino bot would just crash when moving the motor or pumping. As the arudino has a built-in short-circuit measure, it would automatically restart when there is a power over load. Hence, the arudino would keep re-initialise and the entire code would go haywire. To solve his issue, we tried switching off the energy consuming parts before running another part. Although this worked, it was still unreliable. In the end, I figured out a solution, which was not perfect but still worked. I came across this idea when whenever I plugged in the USB cable to my computer and has the main power socket turned on, the Arduino would have enough electricty to run and not have crashing issues. Thus as you can see in the videos above^, I simply connected another power socket to the Arduino. </small>
